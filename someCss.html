            <h2> How Unusual </h2>
            <p> It is difficult to understand as to why this here, that which you preceive at this very moment, would be considered 'unassuming'. There is no real reason as to why this would be called as such; however, it is. The question that should be asked is no 'why', but rather 'when'. But why 'when' and not 'why'? Before your eyes once laid an unassuming mass of white and black. Therefore, it was usassuming.</p>

        <div id = "NowCurious">
            <h2> Now Curious </h2>
            <p> But why now must it be considered unassuming? Has it not been changed to take a form that no longer suits such a title? "Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back."</p>
